# Vclay Calculation

Larionov equation (Larionov, 1969), is one of the most common equations used to convert Vclay from Gamma Ray (GR). For the purpose of evaluating the shallow unconsolidated sand in the Gulf Coast region, the common equation used is the young rock method. The calculation is as follows: 

```math
V_{cl} = 0.083[2^{(3.7 \times I_{GR})} - 1.0]
